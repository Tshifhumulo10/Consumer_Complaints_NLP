![R (1)](https://github.com/Tshifhumulo10/Consumer_Complaints_NLP/assets/115041717/0b44480f-ee3e-4844-a4fe-34cfa4891423)


In the fast-paced and interconnected world of modern business, customer feedback plays a crucial role in shaping the success of any organization. Companies across various industries receive a multitude of complaints from their customers daily. Effectively handling these complaints and routing them to the appropriate departments for timely resolution is essential for maintaining customer satisfaction and streamlining internal operations.

To address this challenge, I am embarking on an innovative project to develop a cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) model. The primary objective of this model is to read and comprehend natural language in customer complaints, enabling us to automatically route each complaint to the right department or team for efficient and tailored resolution.
